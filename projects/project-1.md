The Nintendo Switch is a video game console developed by Nintendo, released worldwide in most regions on March 3, 2017. In this case competition, I was tasked to forecast the US sales of Nintendo Switch in the first week in May.

The following code is run through Jupyter Notebook. I worked with Scikit-Learn, the machine learning framework, to build different regression models to predict the sales amount of Nintendo Switch and evaluated them with cross validation.

## Algorithms Used
Random Forest

LightGBM

Extreme Gradient Boosting

Multilayer Perceptron
  
Long Short-Term Memory
