## Defination

In machine learning, support-vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is a popular machine learning tool that offers solutions for both classification and regression problems. 

## Hard Margin

If the training data is linearly separable, we can select two parallel hyperplanes that separate the two classes of data, so that the distance between them is as large as possible. The region bounded by these two hyperplanes is called the "margin", and the maximum-margin hyperplane is the hyperplane that lies halfway between them.

## Soft Margin
To extend SVM to cases in which the data are not linearly separable, we introduce the hinge loss function, which allows some error made.
